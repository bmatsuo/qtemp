==========================

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these CPAN modules and libraries (www.cpan.org):

    Getopt::Euclid
    Exception::Class
    Moose
    Parse::RecDescent

This program is designed to run on Mac OS X and Linux. It has been
tested under OS X Leopard with a default installation of perl (5.8.9).
It has also been tested on ubuntu 10.04 (perl 5.10).
I suspect that there will be problems on Windows due to carriage returns. 
There has just never been any testing on Windows.

If you want to install to somewhere other than /usr/local,
