DESCRIPTION
       qtemp is a template managing program. It is currently used generally to
       quickly create new scripts (perl, python, ...).

       qtemp prints templates either to STDOUT or to a file.

       Templates can have substitution variables in them, which allow custom
       information (e.g. filename, creation date, etc.) to be inserted into
       the template at the time of generation.

       When templates are written to a file, the template can also specify
       commands to execute after writing. This could include running chmod on
       script files, or perhaps adding and making an initial commit in a
       version control system.

TEMPLATES
       Templates can be added to a searched template directory.

       Templates treat patterns of the form /$./ as macro substitutions and
       will be replaced when the template is printed.

       A single line with only two exclaimation marks denotes the end of the
       template. The remaining lines of the template file are treated as a
       shell script and executed when the template is written to a file.

SUBSTITUTIONS
       String substitutions to be made in templates can be defined in .subs
       files and placed in a searched subs directory.

       Substitutions are defined one-per-line in a .subs file.

       A substitution definition consists of a single character X (the
       substitution name) followed directly by an equal sign. The remaining
       characters on the line of a substitution definition (minus the newline
       character) are used as the substition string for the pattern $X.

       The pattern '$$' in template files is special and is substituted for a
       single '$' always. A substitution for '$' can not be defined and will
       cause the program to crash.
